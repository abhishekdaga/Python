**Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors**

**Description**
This Python program reads the contents of a text file named sample.txt and prints each line with a line number. It also handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

**How It Works**
The program attempts to open sample.txt in read mode.
Each line of the file is printed along with its line number.
If the file is not found, an appropriate error message is displayed.

**How to Run**
Ensure Python 3 is installed.
Place sample.txt in the same directory as the Python file.
Run the program.

**Task 2: Write, Append, and Read a File**

**Description**
This Python program demonstrates basic file handling operations. It takes user input, writes it to a file, appends additional text, and then reads and displays the final content of the file.

**How It Works**
The program asks the user to enter text and writes it to output.txt.
It then asks for additional text and appends it to the same file.
Finally, it reads and prints the complete contents of the file.

**How to Run**
Make sure Python 3 is installed.
Save the program in a .py file.
Run the program.
