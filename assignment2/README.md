**Task 1:**

**Description**

This Python program takes an integer input from the user and determines whether the number is even or odd.
It uses the modulus operator (%) along with an if–else condition to perform the check.

**How It Works**

The user is prompted to enter an integer.

The program checks the remainder when the number is divided by 2:

If the remainder is 0, the number is even.

Otherwise, the number is odd.

The result is displayed to the user.


**Task 2:**
Sum of Integers from 1 to 50

**Description**

This Python program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. 
It iterates through the numbers, adds each value to a running total, and prints the final result.

**How It Works**

Initializes a variable sum to store the total.

Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50.

Adds each number to sum.

Prints the final sum.
